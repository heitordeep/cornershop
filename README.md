# Cornershop - Employment test

## Before you start:

I recommend to use pyenv to run the application and to use version of ```Python 3.7``` , but it's your preference :D 

1) Installation requirements:
   ```shell
    $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```
2) Folder access to run application:

   **cornershop/backend_integration/crawl_groceries**
   
   Where is the ```scrapy.cfg``` file

## Run application:
   ```shel
   $ scrapy crawl walmart
   ```
   The data will be stored in sqlite.
